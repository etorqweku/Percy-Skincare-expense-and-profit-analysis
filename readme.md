## Name
Percy Skincare expense and profit analysis

## Task
Percy Skincare has provided you with access to their revenue dataset. The company has informed you that the start date for keeping track of advertisement expenses and profit generated is January 11th, 2005 and the end date is October 23rd, 2019. Your task is to create a column in the dataset that holds the date with a frequency of months. Then, plot the data to identify trends in expenses and profits over time. Additionally, create two new columns that hold the month name and day name for each transaction. Then group the data by month to create a new DataFrame to obtain the average expense and the standard deviation of profit. Next, group the data by day to create a new DataFrame that contains expenses and profits that are greater than the average expense and profit. Finally, group the data by year and plot separately for each year the trend of the data.
